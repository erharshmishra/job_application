## Job Application Form (Web)
This is a simple and responsive **Job Application Form** built with HTML and CSS. It allows users to input their personal details and submit a job application online.

## 📝 Features
- Input fields for:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email
  - Job Role (Dropdown)
  - Address (Textarea)
  - City
  - Pincode
  - Start Date (Date Picker)
  - Upload CV (File Upload)
- Clean and user-friendly design
- Responsive layout (based on linked CSS)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Fill out the form fields.
4. Click the **Apply Now** button to submit.

> **Note:** This form currently does not have backend integration. The `action` attribute in the form is empty, so submission will not go anywhere unless connected to a backend service.
